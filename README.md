CSE 6331 : Map Reduce in Scala to take nodes as input and give count of number connected components of each undirected graph

Project Description
You are asked to re-implement Project #3 (Graph Processing) using Spark and Scala. Do not use Map-Reduce. 
That is, your program must find the connected components of any undirected graph and prints the size of these connected components. 
A connected component of a graph is a subgraph of the graph in which there is a path from any two vertices in the subgraph. 
Please look at Project #3 for an example.

Steps to setup and execute are given in the project5.txt file.
